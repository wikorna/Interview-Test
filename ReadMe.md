```
and return `401 Unauthorized` if the `x-api-key` is invalid.

      "roleName": "pack operation"
    },
    {
      "roleId": 3,

    }
  ],
  "permissions": [

    "2-02-packing-start",
    "2-03-packing-confirm",
    "2-04-packing-report",
    "3-01-printing-label"
  ]
}
```

`ExpectResult2.json`
```json
{

}
```

- Implement API by using `dependency injection` for interface `IUserRepositoy` file to return the model similar to the `ExpectResult1.json` and `ExpectResult2.json` as following:
  - `GET /api/user/GetUserById/{id}` in `UserController` file. as below:

```csharp
[HttpGet("GetUserById/{id}")]
public ActionResult GetUserById(string id)
{
    //Todo: Implement this method
    return Ok();
}
```

public ActionResult CreateUser(UserModel user)
{
    //Todo: Implement this method
